# MyGenome
Analyses for ABT480/CS485G genome assembly 

## 1. Analyses of sequence quality 
The F1 and R1 sequence datasets were analyzed using FASTQC: 
```bash
ssh -Y cjea222@cjea222.cs.uky.edu
cd MyGenome/A16
fastqc &
```
Load F1 and R1 datasets into GUI interface. 
Take screen shots of output files:

## 2. Ran trimmomatic
```bash
java-jar...
```

## 3. Count number of forward reads remaining
```bash
grep...
```

## 4. Count the total number of bases in both the forward and reverse files. 
```bash
grep...
```

## 5. Analyses of trimmed sequence quality
```bash
ssh -Y cjea222@cjea222.cs.uky.edu
cd MyGenome/A16
fastqc &
```
